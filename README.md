# About

Surf's Up is a website created for surfers to easily check the local beach conditions and determine whether or not it is viable to surf. The website has other features such as 5 of the closest beaches to your local beach which will load when the website is opened or will load when you search for beach, then the 5 beaches will appear based on the beach you searched. Another feature of the website is the ability to save your favorite beaches which makes it easier and simpler to check the conditions of said beach. If you do not know how to get to the beach our "Get Directions" button will show you the way.

## How it Works

Our website uses two APIs, SurfLine and Google maps. SurfLine is used to generate all the information regarding the current conditions of the selected beach, such as Weather and Water Temperature, Wave Height and Speed and Surf Condition.
Google maps is being used to gather the user's approximate location and, if needed, the directions to the user's selected beach destination. 

## Future Features

Our forthcoming features will be rolled out at a later date. Our users can expect to see upcoming features such as a 5 day forecast, SMS text to alert when the conditions are best to surf, the ability to plan surf trips, beach ratings and user recommendations (called *ASK KEVIN). This is our current plan and more features will be added as the site progresses.
